# Raw code usage:

- LIBRA fine-tuning code
  - Use paired-omics arrays as input for fine_tune_libra.py
    - Use "fine_tune_libra.py" for networks training
    - Use "Metrics_LIBRA.R" for additional quality metrix computation
    > **Outputs: Different outputs generated during the training will be stored in the working directory.**

# Raw code usage:

- LIBRA fine-tuning code
  - Use paired-omics arrays as input for fine_tune_libra.py
    - Use "fine_tune_libra.py" for networks training
    > **Outputs: Different outputs generated during the training will be stored in the working directory.**

  -PPJI metric computation over all fine-tune models:
    - Use **supp_code.R** stored at [R code](https://github.com/TranslationalBioinformaticsUnit/LIBRA/blob/main/R/) employed on LIBRA manuscript.

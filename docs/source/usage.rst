LIBRA
========

LIBRA is a Python toolbox for Single-Cell data integration and prediction.
This project aims to lower the barrier for new users to AI state-of-the-art techniques and propose an ubalanced-AE for shared latent representation extraction between two paired-Single-Cell omics. Through this model different steps in the downstream analysis are easily accomplished while retains good timing in opposite to other AI methods that requires many hours to finish the training processes. This is how a good balance between speed and accuracy is obtained.
